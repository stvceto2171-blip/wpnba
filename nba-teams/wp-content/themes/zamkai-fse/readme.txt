== Description ==

Theme from the Zamkai Master, created with simplicity in mind. A perfect starting point for website creators that want a basic theme which won't tax their web server. 
This theme has basic patterns and layouts that can help you jump start with basic WordPress blocks. The theme just defines templates, palettes and patterns. No 'functions.php' here, I have left functionality to the plugins.
